Ares Features
=============

Changes in v0.1.35.0:
=============

EMP Warheads:
	[Warhead]EMEffect = boolean
	[Warhead]EMP.Duration = integer

INI Flag renaming:
	[Weapon]BeamColor => Beam.Color
	[Weapon]BeamPeriod => Beam.Duration
	[Weapon]BeamAmplitude => Beam.Amplitude
	[Weapon]CustomBeam => Beam.IsCustom

TS style Lasers:
	[Weapon]Wave.IsLaser = boolean
	[Weapon]Wave.IsBigLaser = boolean
	I cannot honestly tell the difference between the two, but that may just be me. 

All waves:
	This involves Sonic Wave, TS Lasers and Magnetron Waves as they're all descendants of the same logic:
	[Weapon]Wave.Color = r,g,b ; tested only on TS Lasers so far, but coded for all. Might cause IEs on the other two.

Customizable Ivan Bombs:
	Applicable to all weapons carrying warheads with IvanBomb=yes. All default to the settings in [General]. Units producing the Bomb are immune to its detonation effects, will be customizable later.
	[Weapon]IvanBomb.Warhead = warhead_name
	[Weapon]IvanBomb.Damage = integer
	[Weapon]IvanBomb.Delay = integer
	Note: the following flags have not been tested yet.
	[Weapon]IvanBomb.AttachSound = sound_name
	[Weapon]IvanBomb.TickingSound = sound_name
	[Weapon]IvanBomb.FlickerRate = integer ; bug: it seems there's an off-by-one error somewhere in the code, the last stage of a ticking bomb is invisible
	[Weapon]IvanBomb.Detachable = boolean ; can engineers remove it?
	[Weapon]IvanBomb.Image = filename.shp ; with the extension

Attribution:
	Startup screen displays several information messages.

Misc:
	Skipping multiple useless log entries at startup.

(Initial version) v0.1.1.0:
=============

Command Line Arguments:
	Disable the EA and WW logo using the "-NOLOGO" command line argument.
	Enable log file writing (DEBUG.TXT) using the "-LOG" command line argument.
	Truly disable the CD checks using the "-CD" command line argument.

Engine Enhancements:
	NOT HOOKED: Sound files now also work outside a BAG file.
	Unlimited (theoretically) countries possible, added following tags for (all) countries:
		File.Flag=(string) ;Flag filename (including .pcx extension)
		File.LoadScreen=(string) ;LoadScreen filename (including .shp extension, also requires a %s for the current screen width!)
		File.LoadScreenPAL=(string) ;LoadScreen palette filename (including .pal extension)
		File.Taunt=(string) ;Taunt filename (including taunts subdir and .wav extension, also requires a %02i for the taunt ID!)
		LoadScreenText.Name=(csflabel) ;Name of the country displayed on the loading screen
		LoadScreenText.SpecialName=(csflabel) ;Name of the country's special weapon displayed on the loading screen
		LoadScreenText.Brief=(csflabel) ;Description of the country displayed on the loading screen
		MenuText.Status=(csflabel) ;Brief description of the country displayed in the status bar of the selection menu
		RandomSelectionWeight=(number) ;how likely it is, out of <sum of all weights>, that this country gets chosen as "Random", default is 1
	All countries with Multiplay=yes will appear in the list and can be picked by selecting "Random".
	Unlimited (theoretically) sides possible, side properties now get read from a section as well. These are the possible tags:
		INCOMPLETE: DefaultDisguise=(infantrytype) ;default disguise infantry
		Crew=(infantrytype) ;crew infantry
		SurvivorDivisor=(number) ;survivor divisor
		AI.BaseDefenses=(buildingtype list) ;list of base defense buildings
		AI.BaseDefenseCounts=(number list) ;the amount of each defense building
		AI.PowerPlant=(buildingtype) ;the power plant of this side
		NOT YET SUPPORTED: LoadTextColor=(colorscheme) ;the color to use on the loading screen
		ParaDrop.Types=(infantrytype/vehicletype list) ;default paradrop squad for tech airports - ACCEPTS VEHICLES
		ParaDrop.Num=(number list) ;the amount of each paradropped units
		Sidebar.MixFileIndex=(number) ;the mix file number to use for the sidebar (ie 0 is Allied, 1 is Soviet etc)
		Sidebar.YuriFileNames=(yes/no) ;use yuri sidebar file names
		NOT YET SUPPORTED: EVA.Tag=(string) ;name of the ini tag to load in evamd.ini for this side
	BaseUnit, BuildConst and HarvesterUnit allow more than 3 entries to work
	Only one ParaDrop plane is sent even if multiple unit types are specified

Random Map Generator:
	Archipelago maps enabled.
	Desert maps enabled.
	Bridge placement enabled.
	Preview drawing avoided in many parts to increase random map generation speed by about 75%. More to come...

Buildings:
	Custom Foundations possible (use FoundationMaker).

Miscellaneous:
	Bindable Map Snapshot command that saves the current map to a file.
	Bindable AI Control command that lets the AI assume control over you.
	Skirmish can be played alone.

Bugfixes:
	#277 - VeteranInfantry, VeteranUnits and VeteranAircraft show promoted cameos if possible.
	#??? - Naval=yes vehicles no longer show deceiving promoted cameos after a War Factory has been infiltrated.
	#??? - Insignificant=yes and/or DontScore=yes block the EVA_UnitLost event.
	#297 - Jumpjet vehicles and Aircraft with Crewed=yes spawn parachuting pilots after destruction. NOTE: Needs work.
		Vehicles spawn the proper infantry from [General]xxxCrew= or a Technician, and the spawning only has the [General]CrewEscape= percentage chance of happening (before it checks for obstacles on the ground). Health is randomized from 5 HP to 50% maximum HP.
		Aircraft spawn the same infantry but with 100% chance given clear terrain. Health is always 50% maximum, all veterancy from the plane is carried over.
	#??? - MakeInfantry playing on an occupied area no longer leaks memory until game end, instead it just ends with no spawning. UNTESTED.

Ivan Bombs:
	Infantry and Vehicles can use them with proper cursors. Ivan=yes is no longer needed, the cursors are automatically enabled when applicable.
	Buildings can use them as long as the cursor is not enabled. Uncomment the line starting with "447512" in the INJ to see.
	Aircraft cannot use them at all, they cause IEs, to be figured out later. For now, do not use IvanBomb=yes warheads on aircraft.

Customizable RadBeams:
	[Weapon]BeamColor=R,G,B
	[Weapon]BeamPeriod=integer  ; defaults to: 15
	[Weapon]BeamAmplitude=float ; defaults to: 40.0
	Period and Amplitude define the wave shape, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Sine_voltage.svg and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude
	[Weapon]CustomBeam= boolean ; defaults to yes - if the rules customized the beam and you want to roll it back to default settings in a map/gamemode, use this. UNTESTED, but should work anyway.
