	Unlimited (theoretically) sides possible, side properties now get read from a section as well. These are the possible tags:
		DefaultDisguise=(infantrytype) ;default disguise infantry

	BaseUnit, BuildConst and HarvesterUnit allow more than 3 entries to work
	Only one ParaDrop plane is sent even if multiple unit types are specified

Random Map Generator:
	Archipelago maps enabled.
	Desert maps enabled.
	Bridge placement enabled.
	Preview drawing avoided in many parts to increase random map generation speed by about 75%. More to come...

Buildings:
	Custom Foundations possible (use FoundationMaker).

Miscellaneous:
	Bindable Map Snapshot command that saves the current map to a file.
	Bindable AI Control command that lets the AI assume control over you.
	Skirmish can be played alone.

Bugfixes:
	#277 - VeteranInfantry, VeteranUnits and VeteranAircraft show promoted cameos if possible.
	#??? - Naval=yes vehicles no longer show deceiving promoted cameos after a War Factory has been infiltrated.
	#??? - Insignificant=yes and/or DontScore=yes block the EVA_UnitLost event.
	#297 - Jumpjet vehicles and Aircraft with Crewed=yes spawn parachuting pilots after destruction. NOTE: Needs work.
		Vehicles spawn the proper infantry from [General]xxxCrew= or a Technician, and the spawning only has the [General]CrewEscape= percentage chance of happening (before it checks for obstacles on the ground). Health is randomized from 5 HP to 50% maximum HP.
		Aircraft spawn the same infantry but with 100% chance given clear terrain. Health is always 50% maximum, all veterancy from the plane is carried over.
	#??? - MakeInfantry playing on an occupied area no longer leaks memory until game end, instead it just ends with no spawning. UNTESTED.

Ivan Bombs:
	Infantry and Vehicles can use them with proper cursors. Ivan=yes is no longer needed, the cursors are automatically enabled when applicable.
	Buildings can use them as long as the cursor is not enabled. Uncomment the line starting with "447512" in the INJ to see.
	Aircraft cannot use them at all, they cause IEs, to be figured out later. For now, do not use IvanBomb=yes warheads on aircraft.

Customizable RadBeams:
	[Weapon]BeamColor=R,G,B
	[Weapon]BeamPeriod=integer  ; defaults to: 15
	[Weapon]BeamAmplitude=float ; defaults to: 40.0
	Period and Amplitude define the wave shape, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Sine_voltage.svg and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude
	[Weapon]CustomBeam= boolean ; defaults to yes - if the rules customized the beam and you want to roll it back to default settings in a map/gamemode, use this. UNTESTED, but should work anyway.
